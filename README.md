- # Hello! I'm Jon ðŸ‘‹ 
I am currently a Customer Solutions Consultant for <a href="https://www.infoverity.com/">Infoverity</a> mastering and governing all data pipelines of your business. I've worked on a variety of clients, from an International Tire and Wheel Retailer to a Multinational Fortune 500 Software Company. My experience I've gained around how large corporate infastructures were built and managed, the problems they faced, and the solution we provided has helped me grow professionally/technically very quickly. My Computer Science passion never stops. I've always been thinking of better ways to solve a solution. I see decentralization, cloud, digital art, and online presence growing exponentially and wish to be a part of the front lines of technology. Therefore, I've been starting to apply my skills by building applications with ReactJS in order to grow my skills to later build UIs to sit over my blockchain projects. If your interests fall in the ball park with mine message me!
